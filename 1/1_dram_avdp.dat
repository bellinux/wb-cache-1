40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported that the}} mitochondria inhibitor 3 -nitropropionic acid (3 -NP), induces the expression of DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator <b>1</b> (<b>DRAM</b> <b>1)</b> and activation of autophagy in rat striatum. Although the role of <b>DRAM</b> <b>1</b> in autophagy has been previously characterized, the detailed mechanism by which <b>DRAM</b> <b>1</b> regulates autophagy activity has not been fully understood. The present study investigated the role of <b>DRAM</b> <b>1</b> in regulating autophagy flux. In A 549 cells expressing wilt-type TP 53, 3 -NP increased the protein levels of <b>DRAM</b> <b>1</b> and LC 3 -II, whereas decreased the levels of SQSTM 1 (sequestosome 1). The increase in LC 3 -II and decrease in SQSTM 1 were blocked by the autophagy inhibitor 3 -methyl-adenine. Lack of TP 53 or knock-down of TP 53 in cells impaired the induction of <b>DRAM</b> <b>1.</b> Knock-down of <b>DRAM</b> <b>1</b> with siRNA significantly reduced 3 -NP-induced upregulation of LC 3 -II and downregulation of SQSTM <b>1,</b> indicating <b>DRAM</b> <b>1</b> contributes to autophagy activation. Knock-down of <b>DRAM</b> <b>1</b> robustly decreased rate of disappearance of induced autophagosomes, increased RFP-LC 3 fluorescence dots and decreased the decline of LC 3 -II after withdraw of rapamycin, indicating <b>DRAM</b> <b>1</b> promotes autophagy flux. <b>DRAM</b> <b>1</b> siRNA inhibited lysosomal V-ATPase and acidification of lysosomes.

40|$|SummaryAutophagy is an {{important}} defense mechanism against mycobacteria, the causative agents of tuberculosis. The molecular mechanisms that link mycobacterial recognition to autophagy remain unclear. Our analysis in zebrafish and human macrophage models of mycobacterial infection reveals that the DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator <b>DRAM</b> <b>1</b> functions downstream of pathogen recognition by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) /interleukin- 1 receptor (IL 1 R) -MYD 88 -NF-κB innate immune sensing pathway to activate selective autophagy.

At the same time,novel {{applications such as}} high-end mobile devices require a significant reduction inenergy consumption per operation. Embedded memories {{are one of the}} most criticalbuilding blocks in these contemporary systems, and they {{are one of the most}} likelytechnical bottlenecks for further scaling. Typical low power mobile applications are implemented using a heterogeneousmulticore architecture at system level. A novel, dynamic ram based, memoryarchitecture is proposed for such systems, that could be used for scratchpad memoriesand datapads. This low power DRAM (LPDRAM) architecture can bring an energyconsumption improvement over existing implementations of level 2 and 3 memories. This work will focus on studying circuit level LPDRAM implementations for level 2 scratchpads. Not every DRAM technology is suited to implement LPDRAM. This is due to thefocus put on improving the power consumption. This work studies implementationsfor two technologies: eDRAM and 3 DDRAM. eDRAM technology offers higherdensity compared with SRAM at the cost of increased energy consumption andcomplexity. New optimized DRAM architectures are also being developed for use in 3 D interconnected systems, and should be suitable for mobile applications. This thesisproposes to use both technologies to implement LPDRAM, under the assumption thatsuch technologies becomes available. Different types of SRAM cells and DRAM matrices are studied, to show that themain limitation for using eDRAM is their latency, while stand alone DRAM matricesare mainly limited by their high dynamic energy per access. The electrical factorsresponsible for these differences (longer bitlines, larger memory matrices, etc [...] .) areidentified, and the principles for a DRAM architecture alleviating these penalties isproposed. It is shown that in a typical embedded system working at a reasonably highspeed (around 1 GHz in 90 nm), using modified bitline architecture could bring a lowerstatic energy per bit as well as a higher density than embedded SRAM for L 2 memories. Two prototypes are designed, demonstrating improved dynamic energy consumptionand density, when compared with state of the art SRAM matrices.

40|$|AbstractAutophagy is a self-degrading {{process that}} is {{triggered}} by diverse stimuli including ionizing radiation. In this study we show novel phenomena in which transfection of miR- 199 a- 5 p mimic significantly suppresses IR-induced autophagy in MCF 7 cells, and up-regulates basal and IR-induced autophagy in MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cells. We also identify <b>DRAM</b> <b>1</b> and Beclin 1 as novel target genes for miR- 199 a- 5 p. Overexpression of miR- 199 a- 5 p inhibits <b>DRAM</b> <b>1</b> and Beclin 1 expression in MCF 7 cells, while it enhances expression of these genes in MDA-MB- 231 cells. Furthermore, we show that miR- 199 a- 5 p sensitizes MDA-MB- 231 cells to irradiation. Therefore, our data identify miR- 199 a- 5 p as a novel and unique regulator of autophagy, which {{plays an important role}} in cancer biology and cancer therapy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a practical self-recharging circuitry for DRAMs. The proposed self-recharging circuitry not only reduces the standby power by monitoring the voltage drop {{caused by the}} data loss of a memory cell, but also adjusts the recharging period of the memory cell which is resulted from leakage currents. The proposed design is insensitive to temperature variations. A <b>1</b> -Kb <b>DRAM</b> using our design is fabritcated by TSMC 0. 35   m 1 P 4 M CMOS process. The physical measurement of the proposed design on silicon verifies the correctness of the proposed circuitry. Index Terms — adaptive self-recharging circuitry, DRAM, selfrecharg...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to reduce energy consumption of DRAM/flash memory system by lowering the frequency of DRAM refreshes. The approach is based on two ideas: (<b>1)</b> a <b>DRAM</b> based swap-cache that reduces the number of writes to the flash memory by keeping dirty pages as long as possible; and (2) OS-controlled page allocation/aging policy that stops refreshing for banks, whose pages are clean and not accessed for a long time. Simulations show that the approach can reduce the DRAM refresh energy by 59 - 74 % and the overall energy of DRAM/flash memory system by 8 - 24 % without increase in the execution I...|$|R
