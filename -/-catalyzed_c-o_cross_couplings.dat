The first prerequisite for handling these defects is to detect their beginnings and ends. Two servo loops are formed to keep the optical pick-up focused on, and radially tracked at the information track on the Compact Disc. The pick-up feeds the controllers with sensor signals, and some signals for defect detection. However, due to optical <b>cross</b> <b>couplings</b> detection based on these signals can at times give false or no detections.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the optimal spectrum management problem in multiuser frequency selective interference channels. First, a simple pairwise condition for FDMA to be optimal is discovered: for any two {{among all the}} users, {{as long as the}} normalized <b>cross</b> <b>couplings</b> between them two are both larger than or equal to 1 / 2, orthogonalization between these two users is optimal for every existing user. Therefore, this single condition applies to achieving all Pareto optimal points of the rate region. Furthermore, not only is this condition sufficient, but in symmetric channels, it is also necessary for FDMA to be always optimal. When the normalized <b>cross</b> <b>couplings</b> are less than 1 / 2, the optimal spectrum management strategy can be a mixture of frequency sharing and FDMA, depending on usersâ€™ power constraints. We first explicitly solve the sum-rate maximization problem in two user symmetric flat channels by solving a closed form equation, providing the optimal spectrum management with a clear intuition as the optimal combination of flat FDMA and flat frequency sharing. Next, we show that this result leads to a primal domain convex optimization formulation for generalizations to frequency selective channels. Finally, we show that all the general optimization problems with n>= 2 users and an arbitrary weighted sum-rate objective function in non-symmetric frequency selective channels can be solved by primal domain convex optimization with the same methodology...|$|R

The reliability and availability of the proposed WPT system can be dramatically improved due to the four energy transmission paths. A three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) tool ANSYS MAXWELL (ANSYS, Canonsburg, PA, USA) is adopted to investigate the proposed magnetic coupling structure.

40|$|In {{models with}} {{discrete}} flavour symmetries, flavons {{are critical to}} realise specific flavour structures. Leptonic flavour mixing originates from the misalignment of flavon vacuum expectation values which respect different residual symmetries in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors. Flavon <b>cross</b> <b>couplings</b> are usually forbidden, {{in order to protect}} these symmetries. Contrary to this approach, we show that <b>cross</b> <b>couplings</b> can play a key role and give raise to necessary corrections to flavour-mixing patterns, including a non-zero value for the reactor angle and CP violation. For definiteness, we present two models based on $A_ 4 $. In the first model, all flavons are assumed to be real or pseudo-real, with 7 real degrees of freedom in the flavon sector in total. A sizable reactor angle associated with nearly maximal CP violation is achieved, and, as both originate from the same cross coupling, a sum rule results with a precise prediction for the value of the Dirac CP-violating phase. In the second model, the flavons are taken to be complex scalars, which can be connected with supersymmetric models and multi-Higgs models. The complexity properties of flavons provide new sources for generating the reactor angle. Models in this new approach introduce very few degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model and can be more economical than those in the framework of extra dimension or supersymmetry.
