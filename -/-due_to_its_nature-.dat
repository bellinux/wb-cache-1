40|$|Nowadays and {{according}} to Ries (2006 : 14) the mass communication that has been implemented in a globalized world is branded by five ‘revolutions’ that have evolved the way the information is exchanged, allowing to share ideas or opinions of any kind with speed and ease. There is a direct correlation between {{each one of these}} mass communication revolutions that have been democratized and {{the start of a new}} interaction era. That way, such revolutions are defined by a particular mean of communication. These means are: 1) The book, which main characteristic is the information mass distribution as first communication revolution. 2) Newspapers, in which the main characteristic is the periodicity added to the mass distribution. This is the second revolution. 3) The radio broadcast, which has as characteristics the mass distribution, the immediacy and the audio. 4) Television, which adds to the previously mentioned characteristics the movement of images. 5) Finally the Internet, the fifth revolution implied a new element in the transmission of ideas: the interactivity. Nowadays, the electronic means of communication have an unprecedented impact in the way of projects are developed. The electronic information <b>–due</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>nature–</b> has now a more democratic approach of operation, plummeting the power of the great companies and governments. With the creation of the web 2. 0, the common users of Internet have now a huge number of communication tools, which allow them to know –in an immediate, measured and effective way– what they or others think or believe. So, the object that has changed as a main channel is the operation by Internet.

This point is particularly important {{in the study of}} socioeconomic processes, which <b>-due</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> complex <b>nature-</b> are oftentimes difficult or impossible to address adequately using a purely deductive approach only.

40|$|Purpose To {{critically}} {{review the}} use of Delphi techniques in qualitative research for utilising ‘expert’ opinions and to explore through a detailed example, how Policy Delphi {{can be used by}} hospitality researchers {{as an alternative to the}} more widely used Normative Delphi. Design/methodology/approach This paper reflects on the research methodology of a project that explored organisational crisis signals detection using Policy Delphi with a criterion sample comprising 16 senior hotel executives involved in crisis management. Findings The main methodological concerns regarding Delphi are the definition of consensus, the expertise of the panel, its lack of scientific rigour, and <b>-due</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> lack of uniformity- reliability and validity of findings. Policy Delphi by default addresses the first since it does not seek consensus and can, through its design and execution, address the remaining concerns. Research limitations/implications Carefully designed Policy Delphi can offer a powerful research tool for exploratory research in hospitality, particularly for development of policies and strategies within an organisation. Unlike Normative Delphi, it is not intended as a decision making tool, but rather as a tool to generate options and suggest alternative courses of action for consideration. Originality/value The paper presents a valuable research tool that has evaded the attention of many hospitality researchers offering an illustrative example of its use in exploratory research to deliver credible, transferable and confirmable findings. </p...|$|R

40|$|Slovenia -a former Yugoslavian {{republic}} with an area {{of about}} 20 000 km 2 - has been an independent state since 1991. It is a parliamentary democracy with a constitution and currency of its own. The poulation is ethnically homogeneous, composed of about 90 % of Slovenians and some smaller national minorities. The chances of development for Slovenia lie in an integration into a European economic system {{on the basis of}} innovative specialization, flexibility and quality and use of its strategic location. Compared with other States of East and South East Europe that broke away from multi-nation states and moved towards a market economy after the collapse of socialism, Slovenia has some special characteristics that "should make a smooth transition to market economy possible" (Jerai 1992). Among these characteristics are its favourable location in Central Europe, good international transport links, the higher degree of freedom that was already existent in the past, the know how of trade and economic relations, the extended functions of enterprises, the functioning of market mechanisms. Slovenia was <b>-due</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> central location and historical development- closely tied to Central Europe. This had consequences on trade and the economy and made Slovenia the strongest and most competitive Yugoslavian republic. Borders that were traditionally open allowed a strong orientation of the Slovenian economy toward the European and the world market, a representation on the markets of the leading economic power a sizable exchange of goods and services. International cooperation {{is an important factor in}} the economic development of the country. Slovenia is a member of the European organization "Alps-Adria", aspires to become a member of the European Community (via the intermediate step of a treaty of association) and to establish a free trade zone with the states of the EFTA. The ties with the European transport network give the country not only an importance as transit area between Southern or Western Europe and the eastern European countries, but should also yield impulses for regional development. No significant disparities between cities and villages occur because of a polycentrical development. The economy developed evenly and on a relatively high level around the regional centers without forming dominant agglomerations. Small, specialized and flexible economic units and a qualified and diligent work force offer good prospects for future development. The problem of the collapsed intra-Yougoslavian and East European trade is added to the main task of privatization of the economy. The search for new trade partners is connected with a transformation of production as to quality and range of products. Privatization leads to an abolition of efficient nationally owned enterprises and a breaking up of large fields and will also entail a return to traditional production methods and a reduction in agricultural production. It will also endanger jobs in agriculture and the food industry...|$|R

Hence, equality of opportunity is higher in the "land of opportunities".

Labelled graph strategic rewriting provides a formalism in which different models can be generated and compared. Conversely, the study of social networks, with their size and complexity, stimulates the search for structure and efficiency in graph rewriting.

Firstly, it is evident that growth depends on first, import <b>-due</b> <b>to</b> cheap foreign exchange- and second, high level of foreign capital inflow in the financing of import <b>-due</b> <b>to</b> the insufficiency of export revenues. In addition to that, the policy of high interest rate - low level of foreign exchange is the source of the foreign capital inflow. Secondly, import-oriented growth in the economy has shifted towards a situation in which growth rate increases with the increase in the current account deficit and growth rate declines with a decline in the current account deficit, in the last analysis. Finally, when we analyze the growth performance and the unemployment rates correspondingly, it appears that the rate of unemployment will not decrease with the growth rates below 5 %. Briefly, the only way of decreasing the unemployment level is to grow 5 % or more every year. Central Bank has initiated the low interest rate-more realistic foreign exchange policy as of 2011 to restrain the unsustainable current account deficit. Finding this policy a promising one, we developed additional policy proposals in the light of the growth models in the literature to achieve a growth rate over 5 % which is sustainable and not causing unemployment...|$|R
